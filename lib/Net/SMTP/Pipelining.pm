=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements the client side of the SMTP PIPELINING extension, as
specified by RFC 2920 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2920). It extends the
popular Net::SMTP module by subclassing it, you can use Net::SMTP::Pipelining
objects as if they were regular Net::SMTP objects.

SMTP PIPELINING increases the efficiency of sending messages over a high-latency
network connection by reducing the number of command-response round-trips in
client-server communication. To highlight the way regular SMTP differs from
PIPELINING (and also the way of working with this module), here is a comparison
($s is the Net::SMTP or Net::SMTP::Pipelining object, $from the sender and $to
the recipient):

Regular SMTP using Net::SMTP:

    Perl code             Client command        Server response
    $s->mail($from);      MAIL FROM: <fr@e.com>
                                                250 Sender <fr@e.com> ok
    $s->to($to);          RCPT TO: <to@e.com>
                                                250 Recipient <to@e.com> ok
    $s->data();           DATA
                                                354 Start mail,end with CRLF.CRLF
    $s->datasend("text"); text
    $s->dataend();        .
                                                250 Message accepted

Sending this message requires 4 round-trip exchanges between client and server.
In comparison, Pipelined SMTP using Net::SMTP::Pipelining (when sending more than
one message) only requires 2 round-trips for the last message and 1 round-trip
for the others:

    Perl code             Client command        Server response
    $s->pipeline(
      { mail => $from,
        to   => $to,
        data => "text",
       });
                          MAIL FROM: <fr@e.com>
                          RCPT TO: <to@e.com>
                          DATA
                                                250 Sender <fr@e.com> ok
                                                250 Recipient <to@e.com> ok
                                                354 Start mail,end with CRLF.CRLF
                          text
                          .
    $s->pipeline(
      { mail => $from,
        to   => $to,
        data => "text",
       });
                          MAIL FROM: <fr@e.com>
                          RCPT TO: <to@e.com>
                          DATA
                                                250 Message sent
                                                250 Sender <fr@e.com> ok
                                                250 Recipient <to@e.com> ok
                                                354 Start mail,end with CRLF.CRLF
                          text
                          .
     $s->pipe_flush();
                                                250 Message sent

As you can see, the C<pipeline> call does not complete the sending of a single
message. This is because a.) RFC 2920 mandates that DATA be the last command in
a pipelined command group and b.) it is at this point uncertain whether another
message will be sent afterwards. If another message is sent immediately
afterwards, the MAIL, RCPT and DATA commands for this message can be included in
the same command group as the text of the previous message, thus saving a
round-trip. If you want to handle messages one after the other without mixing
them in the same command group, you can call C<pipe_flush> after every call to
C<pipeline>, that will work fine but be less efficient (the client-server
communication then requires two round-trips per message instead of one).

=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 CONSTRUCTOR

=over 4

=item new ( [ HOST ] [, OPTIONS ] )

    $smtp = Net::SMTP::Pipelining->new( @options );

This is inherited from Net::SMTP and takes exactly the same parameters, see the
documentation for that module.

=back

=head2 METHODS

=over 4

=item pipeline ( PARAMETERS )

    $smtp->pipeline({ mail => $from, to => $to, data => $text })
        or warn "An error occurred";

Sends a message over the connection. Accepts and requires the following
parameters passed in a hash reference:

    "mail" - the sender address
    "to"   - the recipient address
    "data" - the text of the message

Server response messages after the DATA command are checked. On success,
C<pipeline> returns true, otherwise false. False is returned if there is any
error at all during the sending process, regardless whether a message was
sent despite these errors. So for example, sending a message to two recipients,
one of which is rejected by the server, will return false, but the message will
be sent to the one valid recipient anyway. See below methods for determining
what exactly happens during the SMTP transaction.

=item pipe_flush ()

    $smtp->pipe_flush() or warn "an error occurred";

Reads the server response, thereby terminating the command group (after a
message body has been sent). Will also return false on any error returned by
the server, true if no error occurred.

=item pipe_codes ()

    $codes = $smtp->pipe_codes();
    print "SMTP codes returned: @$codes\n";

Returns the SMTP codes in server responses to the previous call of C<pipeline>
or C<pipe_flush> in an array reference, in the order they were given.

=item pipe_messages ()

    $messages = $smtp->pipe_messages();
    print "@$_" for @$messages;

Returns the messages in server responses to the previous call of C<pipeline> or
C<pipe_flush> in a reference to an array of arrays. Each server response is an
element in the top-level array (in the order they were given), each line in that
response is an element in the array beneath that.

=item pipe_sent ()

    $sent = $smtp->pipe_sent();
    print "I said: ".join("\n",@$sent)."\n";

Returns the lines Net::SMTP::Pipelining sent to the server in the previous call
to C<pipeline> in an array reference, in the order they were sent. The array
references in the value returned by C<pipe_sent> will always contain the same
number of elements (in the same order) as C<pipe_codes> and C<pipe_messages>,
so you can reconstruct the whole SMTP transaction from these.

=item pipe_errors ()

    $err = $smtp->pipe_errors();
    for ( @$err ) {
        print "Error! I said $_->{command}, server said: $_->{code} $_->{message}";
    }

Returns a reference to an array of hashes which contain information about any
exchange that resulted in an error being returned from the server. These errors
are in the order they occurred (however, there may of course have been
successful commands executed between them) and contain the following information:

    command - the command sent by Net::SMTP::Pipelining
    code    - the server return code
    message - the server return message

=item pipe_recipients ()

    $rcpts = $smtp->pipe_recipients();
    print "Successfully sent to @{$rcpts->{succeeded}}\n";
    print "Failed sending to @{$rcpts->{failed}}\n";
    print "Recipient accepted, send pending: @{$rcpts->{accepted}}\n";

Returns the recipients of messages from the last call to C<pipeline> or
C<pipe_flush>. Note that this may include recipients from messages pipelined
with a previous call to C<pipeline>, because success of a message delivery can
only be reported after the subsequent message is pipelined (or the pipe is
flushed). The recipients are returned in a reference to a hash of arrays, the
hash has the following keys:

    accepted  - Recipient has been accepted after the RCPT TO command, but no
                message has been sent yet.
    succeeded - Message to this recipient has been successfully sent
    failed    - Message could not be sent to this recipient (either because
                the recipient was rejected after the RCPT TO, or because the
                send of the whole message failed).

Each recipient of all messages sent will appear in either the "succeeded" or
"failed" list once, so if all you care about is success you only need to inspect
these two.

=item pipe_rcpts_succeeded ()

    $success = $smtp->pipe_rcpts_succeeded();
    print "Successfully sent to @success}\n";

Convenience method which returns C<< $smtp->pipe_recipients()->{succeeded} >>

=item pipe_rcpts_failed ()

    $failed = $smtp->pipe_rcpts_failed();
    print "Failed sending to @$failed\n";

Convenience method which returns C<< $smtp->pipe_recipients()->{failed} >>

=back

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

Caveat:
While Net::SMTP::Pipelining is a wonderful piece of software (I'd say that,
wouldn't I?), you should consider whether it is the right thing for you. In
general, when sending email, you should not have to worry about the details
of the send process but rather push it out to a mail server near you as simply
as possible. That mail server can then take care of transmitting your email
to its destination (possibly using pipelining), and you won't have to worry
about it. Of course, if you're writing your own mail server in Perl or have any
other reason to want to use this module, you're more than welcome.

Many thanks to David Cantrell for letting me test on his FreeBSD/OS X boxes, that
helped shake out at least one bug. Also thanks to the good folks at
http://www.perlmonks.org, especially mr_mischief.
